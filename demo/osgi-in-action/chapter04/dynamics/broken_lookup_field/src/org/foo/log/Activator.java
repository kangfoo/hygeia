/**
 * Broken code example showing why you shouldn't store a service instance in a
 * long-lived variable like a field. Firstly you can't tell if the service has
 * been removed, and should not be used anymore. Secondly the strong reference
 * to the instance will stop it from being GC'd until the client is GC'd which
 * could be a long time after the original service bundle is uninstalled.
 * 
 * To run this example:
 * 
 *   ./chapter04/dynamics/PICK_EXAMPLE 1
 * 
 * Expected result:
 * 
 *   <3> thread="main", bundle=2 : logging ON
 *   <3> thread="LogService Tester", bundle=2 : ping
 *   ...
 * 
 * If you stop the simple LogService with "stop 1" you should see the following:
 * 
 *   <3> thread="Thread-1", bundle=2 : logging OFF
 *   <!!> thread="LogService Tester", bundle=2 : ping
 *   ...
 * 
 * Which shows the client bundle is still using the removed LogService instance.
 * 
 * Even restarting the simple LogService with "start 1" will have no affect, the
 * test thread will still use the (now invalid) instance until it is stopped.
