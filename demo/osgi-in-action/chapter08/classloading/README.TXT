Example classloading issues
===========================

This folder contains a selection of different classloading issues you might
encounter when using OSGi with third-party libraries or legacy code.

To see a menu of the different examples, use the "PICK_EXAMPLE" script:

  Example classloading issues
  ---------------------------

  1) ClassNotFoundException
  2) NoClassDefFoundException
  3) ClassCastException
  4) No 'uses' constraints
  5) Mismatched 'uses'
  6) Class.forName issues
  7) TCCL loading issues
  0) exit

  Choose an example (1-7):

Enter a number, press return and the example should build and launch itself.
You can also pass this directly to the script, for example "PICK_EXAMPLE 1",
in which case the menu won't appear.
